(Step One: Setting up React)  
```
cd Planhub_App  
npm install  
```

(Step Two: Settng up MongoDB)  
```
cd src/backend

```

### 3. Running the Web App (Dev Build)

Run the script after all the node_modules dependencies are installed. The script can be ran as many
times as the web app needs to be built.
